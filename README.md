## Features

- **Interactive Tools**: Encrypt and decrypt messages with multiple cipher algorithms
- **Visual Learning**: Step-by-step visualization of encryption processes
- **Multiple Cipher Techniques**:
  - Monoalphabetic Ciphers (Additive, Multiplicative, Affine)
  - Polyalphabetic Ciphers (Autokey, Playfair, Vigen√®re, Hill, One-Time Pad)
  - Transposition Ciphers (Rail Fence)
  - Asymmetric Cryptography (RSA)
- **Educational Content**: Mathematical background and historical context for each cipher
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly user interface
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific ciphers quickly

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - React framework for server-rendered applications
- **React** - Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **JavaScript** - Core programming language for cipher implementations
